1	B001E5DZTS	A3SFPP61PJY61S	Not so goaty - which is Good!	Wonderful product! I began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old. She took it with no problems! It was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop breastfeeding. Much better for a child in my eyes. I had tried a formula sample I had received in the mail—it left a greasy film in the bottle... gross. This does not! My daughter will drink it warm or cold—so easy for on the go as well.	0	0
